## 👨‍💻 Cyber Tinkerer | DevOps Automator | Web Minimalist | Some Sort of Nerd

"If it breaks, it bothers me; If it works, I find a way to break it" - *Me 2025*

**WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!**

### 💼 What I Do Professionally

- ⚙️ **Automation**: PowerShell, Bash, Python scripts are my bread and butter for most daily tasks
- 🌐 **Web Development**: Create static site posts with information I gather throughout my nerdy adventures
- 🚀 **DevOps**: Experiment with CI/CD pipelines, taking advantage of Linux toolkits, containerize services, and the cookie-crumb trail of version control

### 🌌 What I Do When Not Corporate

- 🎮 **Casual Strategy Gamer**: Play a variety of strategy games (mostly Civ V, still is the best, @ me)
- 🎸 **Guitarist**: Mostly play metalcore songs, but if you've seen my Spotify playlist, you'll find a bit more variety. Everything from Frank Sinatra to Mongolian Tuvan Throat Singing (didn't even know that was what it was called until I found it)
- 🍿 **Movie Nights With Family**: Have a whole list of movies that I watch with my family every week in the attempt to stay cultured
- 🛠️ **Messing Around Breaking Things**: If I'm not gaming and strumming, I'm more than likely knee deep in a project that I was not forced to be in, but I'll still complain about it
- 🔐 **Researching Cyber Security Practices**: Went to college for this, but I find doing some labs here-and-there is pretty fun
